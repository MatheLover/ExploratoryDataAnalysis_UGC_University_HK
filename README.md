# Brief Introduction 

This project tries to understand the characteristics of undergraduates as well as those graduates from UGC-funded schools through analyzing the dataset provided on https://cdcf.ugc.edu.hk/cdcf/indepthAnalysis.action

In this project, I try to understand several questions:
        1.Which UGC-funded institution has the largest number of undergraduate students throughout 10 years ?
        2.What is the age distribution of local first-year JUPAS undergraduate student populations? 
        3.Where do most first year undergraduates intakes come from? Is the number of mainland students increasing significantly over the years?
        4.Which industry do most graduates work in? Among different schools, which school contributes the most to different sectors?
        5.Is the number of students who discontinue their undergraduate studies increasing?
